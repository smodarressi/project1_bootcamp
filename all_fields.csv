11,Average cost of attendance (academic year institutions),cost,attendance.academic_year,integer,COSTT4_A,,,IPEDS,"The average annual total cost of attendance, including tuition and fees, books and supplies, and living expenses for all full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. It is calculated from values in the IPEDS Institutional Characteristics and Student Financial Aid components. Separate metrics are calculated for academic-year institutions and program-year institutions. For academic-year institutions, average cost of attendance represents an average of all programs and includes only full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled in the fall term. For non-academic-year institutions (program or continuous enrollment), average cost of attendance represents the program with the largest enrollment at the institution, and it includes full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled at any time during the academic year. For programs less than 1 year in length (see LProgram), this represents the cost for the full program."

41,"Completion rate for first-time, full-time students at four-year institutions (150% of expected time to completion)",completion,completion_rate_4yr_150nt,float,C150_4,,,IPEDS,"The proportion of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who completed a degree or certificate at the institution within 150 percent of normal time, calculated from the IPEDS Graduation Rates component. Separate metrics are calculated for 4-year institutions and less-than-4-year institutions. This metric is calculated as the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who completed a degree or certificate divided by the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates in the corresponding completion rate cohort (D150_4, D150_L4). For full-time, first-time, bachelor's degree-seeking undergraduates, 150 percent of normal time is typically 6 years, and for full-time, first-time, associate's degree-seeking undergraduates it is typically 3 years. For full-time, first-time, certificate-seeking undergraduates, the normal time period varies by the length of the program (for example, 9 months for a certificate with a normal completion time of 6 months). Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent. Pooled figures include two cohorts of students."

This metric is calculated as the number of full-time, first-time, undergraduates who completed a degree or certificate divided by the number of full-time, first-time, undergraduates in the corresponding completion rate cohort (D100_4, D100_L4).
